# USB Base Class 02h (Communications and CDC Control) device HANS udev-rules file
#
# This base class is defined for devices that conform to the Communications
# Device Class Specification found on the USB-IF website. That specification
# defines the usable set of SubClass and Protocol values. Values outside of that
# defined spec are reserved.  Note that the Communication Device Class spec
# requires some class code values (triples) to be used in Device Descriptors and
# some to be used in Interface Descriptors.
#
# Spec used to create the rule: http://www.usb.org/developers/defined_class
